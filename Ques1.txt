Inheritance, Polymorphism
Assume the following requirement. A company has different types of employees namely General, Apprentice, Contract.
General employee will have data as empno, name, designation, join date, dob, email
Contract employee will have general data and additional details like start date, end date, 	contractOrganisation
Apprentice will have general data with additional details like start date, end date, reportingTo

Design and implement classes using inheritance and polymorphism to represent the above data. Use base classes to represent the common data and operations/methods. 

Override Object.toString() method in each of the data classes as follows:
                General – EmpNo + “_” + designation
                Contract – EmpNo + “_” + startDate + “_” + endDate
                Apprentice – EmpNo + “_” + startDate + “_” + endDate + “_” + reportingTo

Use overloaded constructors in each data class to set the data

Implement 
getAge() method to return age of the employee based on dob 
getNumberOfMonths() method to return number of months based on join date
showData() method to display  details of general employee, override the same method in other classes to include additional details.
Implement showDuration() to display the number of days between start date and end date for contract and apprentice employees
